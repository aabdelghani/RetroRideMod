# RetroRideMod

## Overview

Welcome to RetroRideMod! This repository is dedicated to transforming classic vehicles by integrating modern control systems for electric windows and lights. By retrofitting old cars with new technology, RetroRideMod bridges the gap between vintage charm and contemporary functionality.

## Features

### Electric Windows Controller

- **Independent Operation:** Each window functions independently for enhanced control.
- **Safety First:** Automatic shutoff after 8 seconds and conditions to ensure safety and prevent accidental damage.
- **Momentary Switch Control:** Utilizes push buttons to manage window operations effectively.

### Vehicle Lights Controller

- **Adaptive Control:** Tailored light control based on the vehicleâ€™s operational state.
- **Modern Signals:** Incorporates modern vehicle signal functionalities including hazard and turn signals that adapt based on ignition status.
- **Dynamic Headlights:** Features high beam flashing and low/high beam switching to enhance driving safety and visibility.

## Hardware Requirements

- **Momentary Switches:** For user inputs.
- **Relays:** To control the motors and lights powerfully and safely.
- **Microcontrollers:** To implement the logic and control sequences.
- **LED Display:** To provide real-time status and feedback.

## Setup

1. Connect all hardware as per the diagrams in the `schematics` folder.
2. Install necessary libraries from `requirements.txt`.
3. Upload the provided code to your microcontroller to bring the modern functionalities to your classic car.

## Usage

Operate your upgraded vehicle systems via intuitive controls designed for safety and reliability. The system ensures all modern safety protocols are met, keeping the vintage aesthetics intact.
